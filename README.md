# HTML-Unit-11-Challenge
The process of this project it to use the web-scraping and data analysis skills learnt so far. In this project I used the skills to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. This challenge helped strengthen the core skills that I have been developing which include: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating your insights.
